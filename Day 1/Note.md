# What is Flutter ?
  
Flutter is a UI toolkit for building fast, beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web and desktop with one programming language and single codebase. It is free and open-source. Initially it was develop from Google and now manages by an ECMA standard. Flutter apps use Dart programming language for creating an app. The first version of Flutter was introduced in 2015 at the Dart Develper summit.

It was initially known as codename ‘SKY’ and can run only on the Android OS. It remained in beta phase until its official launch in 2018, where the stable version was released and under the name ‘Flutter 1.0’. The current stable release is Flutter v1.20.4 that was released in September 2020. Flutter is now in the top 7 software repos based on GitHub stars. Moreover, we’ve already seen thousands of Flutter apps being published on app stores. One of the most notable examples is the Xianyu app created by Alibaba team, used by over 50 million people. And its latest development can be seen in the recent update of ‘Google Pay’, released by Google.

Flutter is different from other frameworks because it neither uses WebView nor the OEM widgets that shipped with the device. Instead, it uses it's own high performance rendering engine to draw widgets. It also implements most of it's systems such as animation, gestures and widgets in Dart programming language that allows developers to read, change, replace, or remove things easily. It gives excellent control to developers over the system. 
  
# Features of Flutter
  
- Open-source
- Hot Reload
- Widgets
- Cross-platform
- Minimal code
- Accessible Native features and SDKs
  
# Advantages of Flutter
  
- It makes app development process extremely fast because of hot-reload feature.
- Flutter reduces the time and efforts of testing.
- It provides smoother and seamless scrolling experiences of using the app without much hangs or cuts, which makes running applications faster in comparison to other mobile app development frameworks.
  
# Disadvantages of Flutter
  
- Flutter is a comparatively new language that needs continuous integration support through the maintainance of the scripts.
- It uses Dart programming for coding, so a developer needs to learn new technologies. (However, it is easy to learn for developers.)
- It provides very limited access to SDK libraries. It means a developer does not have a lot of functionalities to create a mobile application. Such types of functionalities needs to be developed by the Flutter developer themselves.
