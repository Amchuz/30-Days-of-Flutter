# What makes Flutter Unique ?
  
Flutter is different from other frameworks because it neither uses WebView nor the OEM widgets that shipped with the device. Instead, it uses it's own high performance rendering engine to draw widgets. It also implements most of it's systems such as animation, gestures and widgets in Dart programming language that allows developers to read, change, replace, or remove things easily. It gives excellent control to developers over the system.
