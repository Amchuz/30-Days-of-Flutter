Dart is an open-source object-oriented programming language with C-style syntax developed by Google in 2011. Dart is a compiler-based language so we pass the code through compiler phrases and then transfer it into machine code. The purpose of this programming language is to create a frontend user interfaces for the web and mobile apps. It is inspired by programming languages such as C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It supports most of the common concepts of programming languages like classes, functions, interfaces, array and it supports collection which is used to replicate the data structure such as arrays, generic, etc. 
  
Dart does not have explicit keywords like public, private with functions but instead uses underscores to differentiate between public and private functions. It saves a lot of time and improves code simplicity by a long margin. One of the most import features of Dart is a named constructor. You can make multiple constructors in Dart with different names which allow clarity in what the constructor is actually initializing.
  
You can use <a href="https://dartpad.dev/">DartPad</a> an IDE for running dart program.

You can also run sample programs given at the top right side of the page. 
  
## Hello World!
  
Every app has a main() function. To display text on the console, you can use the top-level print() function :
  
```
void main() {
print(‘Hello, World!’);
} 

Output: Hello, World!
```
